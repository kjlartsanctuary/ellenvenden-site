    <h2>About Ellen Veden</h2>

    <p><strong>Princeton, NJ</strong> — A world traveler for both work and pleasure, Ellen Veden is known for her love of life, curiosity, and creative energy. Her multimedia landscapes use light, texture, and color to reveal the spirit of Princeton and its surrounding landscapes. Her exhibition, <span class="highlight">“Princeton Unveiled: Landscapes in Texture and Color”</span>, opened at the Center for Modern Aging on September 25, 2025 (coverage by Linda Sipprelle, Town Topics).</p>

    <p>Veden received a <strong>BFA in Fine Arts</strong> from Wesleyan University, studied at the <strong>Art Institute of Chicago</strong>, and earned an <strong>MA in Anthropology and International Studies</strong> from The New School. A native New Yorker, she lived in a studio loft on Grand Street in SoHo and participated in numerous juried exhibitions with solo shows at the Fimbres Gallery. Her circle of friends included artists and photographers from the post–World War II generation—abstract expressionists like Robert Rauschenberg, Nancy Spero, and photographers like Robert Frank. Included in her recent exhibition at the Center for Modern Aging is a portrait of Veden by painter and print artist June Leaf, Frank’s wife.</p>

    <p>In New York City, Veden taught <strong>art and video production</strong> at the renowned <strong>High School of Music and Art (104)</strong> and the <strong>LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts</strong>. One of her former students, author Jennifer Coburn, warmly credited Veden as an inspiring influence during a lecture at the Princeton Public Library in May 2025.</p>

    <p>Veden also had friends in the burgeoning post–World War II television industry. A producer at NBC discovered one of her student programs on Manhattan Cable Television and offered her a position in television broadcasting. She later worked with <strong>NBC</strong> and <strong>PBS</strong> (where AT&T was a major sponsor), before being recruited by <strong>AT&T</strong> to manage its New York City office for <strong>Skynet Satellite Services</strong>. During this time, she was an active member of the <strong>New York City Arts and Business Council</strong> and volunteered for <strong>The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps</strong>, founded by actor and philanthropist <strong>Paul Newman</strong> to provide summer experiences for seriously ill children.</p>

    <p>Her career evolved internationally, joining <strong>France Telecom</strong>, <strong>Teleglobe Canada</strong>, and <strong>Belgacom</strong> to develop U.S. broadcast satellite networks. Later, she joined <strong>Bellcore</strong> and <strong>Motorola</strong> to expand her expertise in cellular and digital technologies—an extension of her lifelong intellectual curiosity.</p>

    <p>After retiring and relocating to <strong>Princeton</strong> in 2000, Veden reignited her passion for painting and drawing. A naturalist painter, her philosophy aligns with that of French artist <strong>Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot</strong>, who said, “You must interpret nature with entire simplicity and according to your personal sentiment.” Her works reflect that belief—layered, atmospheric studies of color and light.</p>

    <p>Veden is a proud member of the <strong>Creative Collective</strong>, a group fostering artistic community and collaboration. Her works have been displayed in over 50 venues, including the juried <strong>Ellarslie City Museum of Trenton</strong> exhibitions. She serves on the <strong>Board of the Princeton Adult School</strong> and has previously served on the boards of the <strong>Princeton Friends of Opera</strong> and the <strong>Trenton Museum Society at Ellarslie</strong>.</p>

    <p>Her exhibitions are often community-centered, with proceeds supporting local arts and wellness organizations. Her show <span class="highlight">“Princeton Unveiled: Landscapes in Texture and Color”</span> runs through October 10, 2025, at the Center for Modern Aging, where half of the print sales benefit the center’s programs.</p>
