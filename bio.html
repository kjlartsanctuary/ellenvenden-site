      <p>
        Ellen Veden is a painter, teacher, and lifelong creative spirit. Her journey began
        in the vibrant art scene of New York’s SoHo district, where she immersed herself
        in the energy of emerging artists, galleries, and community. Those formative years
        helped shape her approach to art as both a deeply personal practice and a way of
        connecting with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now based in Princeton, New Jersey, Ellen continues to create and exhibit her work.
        Her paintings and drawings reflect decades of exploration, from expressive portraiture
        and landscapes to bold abstractions that celebrate light, color, and emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to her studio practice, Ellen is passionate about teaching. She has worked
        with students of all ages, sharing her love for art and encouraging others to discover
        their own creative voices. Her classes and workshops emphasize experimentation,
        self-expression, and the belief that art can enrich every aspect of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ellen’s work has been exhibited in galleries, cultural centers, and libraries across
        New Jersey and New York. She continues to be inspired by nature, community, and the
        ever-changing dialogue between past and present in the world of art.
